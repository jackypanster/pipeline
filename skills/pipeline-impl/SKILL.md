# pipeline-impl

Stage 4. Follow the **shim loop in CONTRACT.md** with slot = `impl`.

**Coordinated dispatch guard:** if your invocation carries a dispatch envelope
(`repo= branch= feature= expected_seq= expected_commit=`), run CONTRACT §Coordinated mode's pre-write
stale-dispatch guard immediately after step 1, BEFORE any write; any mismatch ⇒ print
`STALE_DISPATCH <field>` and STOP (zero writes). Preserve `control.json`; never modify it.

**Skill:** the `impl` slot runs an autonomous think→design-tests→code→check loop. The pipeline is
runtime-agnostic: bind whichever autonomous-coding skill your runtime provides in `roles.yaml`. Whatever
you bind, the slot value must be that skill's **real, full installed name** on your runtime, never a
bare/abstract token (e.g. the bare word `goal` or the `<autonomous-coding-skill>` placeholder). It writes
**white-box tests in `impl-paths:` (allowed)**; it must NOT create or edit anything under
`spec-paths:`. Constrain it accordingly (a "do not touch spec-paths; do not author acceptance tests"
sub-instruction is the cheap seam if your skill supports one).

## Steps

1. `git pull --rebase`. Read `current.json`. Pick the **oldest** `status: todo` card (or the given
   card-id). Idempotency: if `feat/<feature>` already has an open PR and the card reads
   `status: review`, skip — already in flight.
2. Resolve `impl` slot; verify installed (else STOP). **Create or reconcile the feature branch**
   **`feat/<feature>`** (per CONTRACT §State authority — one branch per feature, NOT per card):
   - **New branch:** cut it from trunk (`main`) — it inherits the current frozen specs.
   - **Existing branch (feature in flight):** if trunk's spec advanced since it was cut (a re-freeze or
     append-card landed a new `spec-rev` the branch lacks), **rebase it onto trunk and force-push**
     (`git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease`) so it carries the
     current frozen tests. Without this, review's freeze gate diffs the new `spec-rev` against the stale
     branch and falsely rejects. This force-push is the **sanctioned exception** (your own in-flight
     branch, never trunk — CONTRACT §State machine scope). Resolve any rebase conflict via the impl loop
     (the spec changed; the code must adapt).
   Then flip the card `status: in-progress` and commit it to **`main`** (card status is trunk-authoritative metadata —
   a cold node must read the live status from trunk; never leave a status flip on the branch). **Leave
   `current.json.stage` at `task`** — `stage` = most-recently-COMPLETED stage (CONTRACT); it advances to
   `impl` only when this card actually completes (step 4), not when work begins.
3. **implement**: code inside `impl-paths:` (+ `src/**`) on `feat/<feature>` until the card's `verify:`
   commands all exit 0 (its red test goes green). The card's `verify` is **card-scoped** (CONTRACT
   §State authority) — it goes green on THIS card's frozen test alone, regardless of sibling cards still
   red on trunk; do NOT run the full suite to judge this card (that is review's final gate). Loop
   think→code→check within the turn budget. Only code lives on the branch; never touch `spec-paths:`.
4. **Green** ⇒ push `feat/<feature>`, open/update a PR via the forge adapter, then on `main` flip the
   card `status: review`, advance `current.json.stage` to `impl`, and **append your handoff to
   `journal.md`** (per §Journal discipline below — file END, exact header, self-verified) — these
   three metadata writes are **one commit on `main`** (this card completed —
   stage = most-recently-completed). Opening the PR needs the repo's forge token (loaded per CONTRACT
   step 2 from `.env` etc.). If the token is absent, **do NOT fail** — push the branch + make that same
   `main` commit (`status: review` + `stage: impl` + journal entry) anyway, and say in the handoff that
   the PR must be opened manually (branch + base named). **Next-card routing:** if the feature still has
   any `status: todo` card,
   hand off to **pipeline-impl** for the next card (the same `feat/<feature>` branch/PR accumulates all
   cards) — this continuation's journal header is **`impl→impl · completed`** (CONTRACT §Coordinated
   mode, stage-consistent transitions: the to-stage names the routed next node, so a mid-feature card
   completion never reads as "feature ready for review"). Only when NO `todo`/`in-progress` cards remain
   (every card is `status: review`) write **`impl→review · completed`** and hand off to
   **pipeline-review** — review runs ONCE on the complete feature, never on a partial one.
5. **Fail / budget exhausted** ⇒ on `main`: `attempts++`, then **decide the disposition by the retry
   budget BEFORE committing** (CONTRACT state machine):
   - **`attempts < 3`** ⇒ `status: todo` (re-queue), journal `status=failed`, next = **pipeline-impl** —
     the `## Attempt N` note is the informed-retry context (NOT a blind retry; this is the intended retry
     budget; hunt is for blocked cards only, so do NOT route here).
   - **`attempts >= 3`** ⇒ `status: blocked`, journal `status=blocked`, next = **pipeline-hunt**
     (root-cause before any re-queue — never blind retry).
   **Leave `current.json.stage` unchanged** (impl did NOT complete — keep `task`). Append the
   `## Attempt N` note + the selected handoff to `journal.md` (§Journal discipline), then **commit the card (`attempts` + the
   decided `status` + note) + `journal.md` together to `main` in ONE commit** — so a cold node never
   reads a half-updated state. Then print the handoff to the routed command (the next run reads only the
   card).

## Journal discipline (mechanical, self-verified)

"Append" means the **physical END of the file**: `>>` in a shell
(`cat >> .pipeline/<feature>/journal.md`), never an editor insert, never the file head, never
between entries. The physically-LAST entry is the run authority (CONTRACT §Run journal), so a
misplaced entry makes your run invisible: drivers/dashboards keep reading the old tail and a driven
run halts on "no progress" (field-failed twice on 2026-07-11 — a driven impl node PREPENDED its
entries, once with fabricated copies of earlier entries, and both runs read as never-completed).

The header must match the CONTRACT template EXACTLY:
`## seq=N · <ISO-8601 UTC> · impl→<to> · <status> · by=<tag>` — seq = current tail's seq + 1;
`<to> · <status>` is whichever disposition steps 4/5 selected: `review · completed` (green, every
card now `review`), `impl · completed` (green, todo cards remain — next-card continuation),
`impl · failed` (informed retry, attempts < 3), `hunt · blocked` (attempts >= 3); REAL clock time:
capture `WRITE_TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)` immediately before composing the entry and put
that exact string in the header (never a placeholder like `00:00:00Z`, never local time wearing a
`Z`); the arrow is `→` with NO spaces around it.

**Self-verify BEFORE printing the handoff (blocking) — run BOTH checks on the committed file:**

1. The physically-last header PARSES against the full template, bound to EXACTLY the three legal
   dispositions, with a non-empty tag and an end anchor:

   ```bash
   tail -40 .pipeline/<feature>/journal.md | grep -E \
     '^## seq=[0-9]+ · [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}Z · impl→(review · completed|impl · completed|impl · failed|hunt · blocked) · by=.+$' \
     | tail -1
   ```

   Illegal transition/status combinations (`impl→review · failed`, `task→done · completed`), a
   spaced arrow, a malformed timestamp shape, and an empty `by=` all miss this match — then the
   header is malformed, full stop.
2. It is YOURS, byte-for-byte: capture `WRITE_TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)` immediately
   before composing the entry and reuse that EXACT string as the header timestamp; the matched
   line must carry your seq, your non-empty `by=` tag, and exactly `$WRITE_TS`. String equality
   with your own just-captured clock leaves no room for placeholder or same-day fabricated
   times — no date math, no tolerance window, portable everywhere.

Fail either check ⇒ the run is INCOMPLETE: repair with a NEW correctly-appended entry (never
rewrite or amend — CONTRACT append-only), then re-verify.

## Hard rules

- Never touch `spec-paths:` (the frozen spec). Never merge. Only this card's files.
- Journal entries go at the file END and are self-verified as the new tail (§Journal discipline) —
  a misplaced or malformed entry means the run does not count as completed.
- Code (`impl-paths`/`src`) lives on `feat/<feature>`; card `status` flips commit to `main` (trunk
  authority — never leave card state stranded on the branch). White-box tests in `impl-paths:` are fine;
  the acceptance test stays frozen.
